        <h1>The Cleary Act</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>In 1990, Congress enacted the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990 (Title II of Public Law 101-542), which amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA). This act required all post-secondary institutions participating in HEAâ€™s Title IV student financial assistance programs to disclose campus crime statistics and security information. The act was amended in 1992, 1998, 2000 and 2008. The 1998 amendments renamed the law the Jeanne Cleary Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act in memory of a student who was slain in her dorm room in 1986. It is generally referred to as the Cleary Act and is in section 485(f) of the HEA.

        <h1>NERC & FERC</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>On the federal level, 2016 has seen the release of updated Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) requirements by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the non-profit empowered by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) with authority to oversee grid security.  The CIP plan is a set of nine standards and some 45 requirements that cover a broad variety of cybersecurity protocols.  Under the CIP plan, utilities are required to identify critical cyber assets and ensure they are protected by electronic security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication.  They must develop plans for incident reporting and recovery, and train personnel on response plans.  The CIP standards even govern physical security measures, such as security guards and visitor logs.
